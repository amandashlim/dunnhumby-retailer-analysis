# dunnhumby-retailer-analysis
Code and report for my "Scenario Week 3" project, part of Year 1 of the BSc Management Science programme at UCL. This was my first ever data analysis group project, so the code is a bit messy! In this report, my team analyzed transaction, product, store location datasets provided by Dunnhumby from an anonymous retailer.


## Research Objectives:
1) Determine the price elasticity of each product

2) Determine the impact of promotions on units per visits

3) Perform Demand Forecasting

## Languages
– R

## Packages & Models
- Visualized data on various types of graphs in R (ggplot): barplot, scatterplot, line graph, ridgeline graph, maps
- Fitted and utilized various models in R: linear regression, multiple linear regression, random forest, regression tree, LASSO, Neural Network

## Business Applications
- Drew insights from graphs and models forming various managerial insights for "The Retailer"
